      <p>Born and raised in sunny San Diego. I'm a huge advocate of Korean BBQ. I have a huge passion of being active whether it being climbing coconut trees,
      extreme sports and anything outdoor related. I absolutely love live music and concerts. Somewhat of a beach bum,
      recently moving to Utah I fell in love with the mountains. I love anything with fashion and creative art.</p>
